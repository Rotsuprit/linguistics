## Object Control in Thai

This project investigates variations in object control in Thai, which are instantiated below.
  1. I forced Sam eat pizza - ฉันบังคับแซมกินพิซซ่า 
  2. I forced Sam hây eat pizza - ฉันบังคับแซมให้กินพิซซ่า 
  3. I forced hây Sam eat pizza - ฉันบังคับให้แซมกินพิซซ่า 

**Preliminary abstract:**
  Object control in Thai exhibits two distinct types of complement clauses based on surface form: non-hây and _hây_-clauses. _Hây_-clauses further show two variants: one in which the controller precedes _hây_ and the other in which it follows _hây_. This study investigates the internal structure of both types and proposes a derivational analysis accounting for the observed controller- _hây_ order switching. I argue that both types of complement clauses are not structurally identical. I argue that non-hây clauses are VPs undergoing full restructuring, while _hây_-clauses are future infinitives projecting WollPs, with the future modal _Woll_ pronounced as _hây_. The theoretical analysis that best explains the alternation of control with _hây_-clauses is the Movement Thoery of Control (MTC), which posits that the controllee/null argument is a copy of A-movement. This alternation can be classified into two variants: forward control and backward control.The movement analysis of control should, therefore, be incorporated into the theory.

## Allomorphic sensitivity
I look at the data in manner adverb reduplication in Thai, which is required in positive imperative, but prohibited in the negative counterpart. The examples are below. 
  1. Walk slowly-slowly/*slowly - เดินช้าๆ     (Positive)
  2. NEG walk slowly/*slowly-slowly - อย่าเดินช้า    (Negative)
