### Object Control in Thai

This project investigates variations in object control in Thai, which are instantiated below.
  1. I force Sam eat pizza
  2. I force Sam hây eat pizza
  3. I force hây Sam eat pizza

**Preliminary abstract:**
Object control in Thai exhibits two distinct types of complement clauses based on surface form: non-_hây_ and _hây_-clauses. _Hây_-clauses further show two variants: one in which the controller precedes _hây_ and the other in which it follows _hây_. This study investigates the internal structure of both types and proposes a derivational analysis accounting for the observed controller-haˆy order switching. I argue that both types of complement clauses are not structurally identical. I argue that non-_hây_ clauses are VPs undergoing full restructuring, while _hây_-clauses are future infinitives projecting WollPs, with the future modal _Woll_ pronounced as _hây_. The theoretical analysis that best explains the alternation of control with _hây_-clauses is the Movement Thoery of Control (MTC), which posits that the controllee/null argument is a copy of A-movement. This alternation can be classified into two variants: forward control and backward control.The movement analysis of control should, therefore, be incorporated into the theory.

### Allomorphic sensitivity
I look at the data in manner adverb reduplication in Thai, which is required in positive imperative, but prohibited in the negative counterpart. The examples are below. 
  1. Walk slowly-slowly/*slowly        (Positive)
  2. NEG walk slowly/*slowly-slowly    (Negative)
