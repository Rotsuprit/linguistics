I am a syntactician. I am currently an MA student in [Linguistics at the University of Kansas (KU)](https://linguistics.ku.edu), where I am supervised by [John Gluckman](https://www.jgluckman.com/index.html). I work on generative **syntax**. I am particularly interested in long-distance dependencies and size of infinitives. My master's thesis is on Object Control in Thai.



**Research interests:** Syntax

**Research Languages:** Thai and Lao
