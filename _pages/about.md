I am currently an MA student in [Linguistics at the University of Kansas (KU)](https://linguistics.ku.edu), where I am supervised by [John Gluckman](https://www.jgluckman.com/index.html). I work on generative **syntax** and its interaction with morphology. 

Before coming to KU, I pursued a bachelor in English and Communication at Ubon Ratchathani University where I was introduced to Generative Syntax by Prof. Supath Kookiatikul. 

**Research Languages:** Thai and Lao

## Current projects
  - Control & Raising in Thai
  - Adverb reduplication in Thai imperatives
