I am currently an MA student in [Linguistics at the University of Kansas (KU)](https://linguistics.ku.edu), where I am supervised by [John Gluckman](https://www.jgluckman.com/index.html). I work on generative **syntax** and its interaction with morphology and semantics. My master's thesis is on Object Control in Thai.

Before coming to KU, I pursued a bachelor's degree in English and Communication at Ubon Ratchathani University, Thailand. During my time there, I was introduced to Generative Syntax by Supath Kookiattikul and was actively involved in multiple research projects led by [Saowanee Alexander.](http://info.la.ubu.ac.th/bio/cv.asp?id=145) 


**Research interests:** Syntax, Morphology, Semantics

**Research Languages:** Thai and Lao
