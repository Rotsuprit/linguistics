I am Ph.D student in [Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://linguistics.mit.edu). Before joining MIT, I earned a master's degree in [Linguistics at the University of Kansas (KU)](https://linguistics.ku.edu), where I was supervised by [John Gluckman](https://www.jgluckman.com/index.html). My research is on **syntax**. I am particularly interested in long-distance dependencies and size of non-finite clauses. 



**Research interests:** Syntax

**Research Languages:** Thai (_native_) and Lao (_native_)

**Contact:**  [rotsupri@mit.edu]() 


    
## Current projects
