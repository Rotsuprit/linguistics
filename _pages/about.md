I am a syntactician. I'm a first-year PhD student in [Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://linguistics.mit.edu). Before joining MIT, I studied for a master's degree [Linguistics at the University of Kansas (KU)](https://linguistics.ku.edu), where I am supervised by [John Gluckman](https://www.jgluckman.com/index.html). I work on generative **syntax**. I am particularly interested in long-distance dependencies and size of non-finite clauses. 



**Research interests:** Syntax

**Research Languages:** Thai (_native_) and Lao (_native_)

**Contact:**  [rotsupri@mit.edu]() 


    
## Current projects
  - _Tough_-constructions
  - Control & Raising in Thai
  - Adverb reduplication in Thai imperatives (Allomorphic Sensitivity)
