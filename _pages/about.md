I am currently an MA student in [Linguistics at the University of Kansas (KU)](https://linguistics.ku.edu), where I am supervised by [John Gluckman](https://www.jgluckman.com/index.html). I work on generative **syntax** and its interaction with morphology and semantics. 

Before coming to KU, I pursued a bachelor in English and Communication at Ubon Ratchathani University, Thailand, where I was introduced to Generative Syntax by Supath Kookiattikul, and involved in multiple research projects led by [Saowanee Alexander.](http://info.la.ubu.ac.th/bio/cv.asp?id=145) 

**Research interests:** Syntax, Morphology, Semantics

**Research Languages:** Thai and Lao

## Current projects
  - Control & Raising in Thai
  - Adverb reduplication in Thai imperatives (Allomorphic Sensitivity)
